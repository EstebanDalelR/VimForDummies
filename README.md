#VimForDummies
<b>A guide for Vim for dummies, made in Vim by a dummie.</b><br>
<b>Why Vim</b><br>
Why not? Well, actually, there are a lot of reason for Vim and against it, I'll begin with why not. <br>
To be blunt, Vim has too much power for the average user and has a learning curve. Most people can do with your office text editor or note taking software.<br> 
Now the reasons for Vim. In my opinion, it looks cool: Matrix style editing, a dark screen with a bleeping cursor. Second, Vim frees you from the mouse, that friend during intense gaming sessions or infinite scrolling in your favorite social network. Vim is great for the non-average user, and if you found this repo, you are probably not average.
Also, it is in almost every Linux distribution, so editing directly in the server is very easy.
First, add vim to your machine<br>
<i>Linux</i> sudo apt-get install vim<br>
<i>Windows</i> ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/pc/gvim80-069.exe<br>
<b>What it is for</b>
Vim is a text editor, a <em>powerful</em> one. The coolest thing about Vim is that it saves you the hassle of using a mouse, everything is done in the keyboard, but it does have a bit of a learning curve.
